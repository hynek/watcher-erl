watcher.erl - a library for monitoring line oriented files

It consists practically only of one public function: `watch/2' which
is started with the file name to monitor (most probably a log file)
and a PID which is notified

1. When a new line arrives:

{line, "text"}

2. The file has been rotated (ie. moved away and replaced by an empty
   file:

file_rotated

.


For convenience, there is also a function `start/2' which takes the
same arguments and whose only purpose is to spawn `watch/2' and return
the PID.
